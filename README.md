# Responsive layout - Adobe XD series (ep. 42)

The design of this project is based on an episode from the Adobe YouTube channel: [Designing Adobe XD - Episode 42 - Responsive Resize | Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/live/8SuevbC6GjA?feature=shared).
I use this episode as a reference to create a responsive layout using CSS Grid, without the need for media queries.

🛠️ Tech Stack: CSS Grid, JavaScript.

I only used JavaScript to open and close the hamburger menu; this is not the main focus of the exercise.
